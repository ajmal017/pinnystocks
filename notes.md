_Pennystocking - the game of trading stocks under $5 a share in pursuit of profits_ 

### General stock notes
- test this out on a 'fanatasy stock' site -- don't spend real money
	- called 'paper trading'
- by the time you hear about a 'hot industry', the profits are lost
	- e.g. marijuana stocks
- buy what you know (tech stocks)
- *SELL QUICKLY*
	- if you begin to make high returns on a stock -- SELL
- focus on penny stocks with high volume (easy to get in and out) 
- don't trade more than 10% of the stock's daily volume
- most penny stocks trade on the OTCBB
- limit holdings and diversify
	- limit holding in a stock to no more than 1-2% of your overall portfolio
